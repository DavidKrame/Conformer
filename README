Dependencies should be installed using the following command before training:
pip install -r requirements.txt


As an example, for training the model of No.11 wind farm, run as follows:

python -u main_informer.py \
		--model informer --data elec --features MS \
		--seq_len 8 --label_len 8 --pred_len 96 --e_layers 2 --d_layers 1 --attn prob --des 'Exp' --itr 1 \
		--root_path ./data/ETT/ --data_path elec11.csv \
		--do_predict \
		--train_start_date "2020-01-01 00:00:00" --train_end_date "2021-03-31 23:45:00" \	
		--val_start_date "2021-04-20 00:00:00" --val_end_date "2021-04-30 23:45:00" \
		--pred_start_date "2021-05-05 00:00:00" --pred_end_date "2021-05-07 23:45:00"


Where "--itr" represents the number of repeats to run the training model, 
"--root_path" is the path to the data file, 
"--data_path" points to the name of data file. 
"--train_start_date" and "--train_end_date" refer to the period for training. 
"--val_start_date" and "--val_end_date" refer to the period for validation. 
"--pred_start_date" and "--pred_end_date" refer to the period for prediction. 

【NOTE】
The period for prediction should begin with "XXXX-XX-XX 00:00:00" and end with "XXXX-XX-XX 23:45:00".



We present the prediction results as a txt file in which each line is the 96 prediction results of a day.

This code is modified from open source: https://github.com/zhouhaoyi/Informer2020

The main modifications includes:
1. Designed a specified data loader for wind farm. The example data is in ./data/ETT.
2. Removed the target in inputs.
3. Measured the specifical accuracy.
4. realize the prediction module.


>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>>The essentials of data file (IMPORTANT!)<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<<
The input data file should be a csv file with at least 6 colunms: 'date', 'pred_w_speed', 'pred_w_dir', 'pred_temp', 'pred_humidity', 'target'.
'date': the date of that row, for example, '2020-01-01 00:00:00'.
'pred_w_speed', 'pred_w_dir', 'pred_temp', 'pred_humidity': Meteorological forecast data including wind speed, wind direction, temperature and humidity. (atmospheric pressure is abandoned)
'target': mean power as the prediction target.

【NOTE】
(1) The provided weather forecasting data (i.e. the input csv file) must contain the records in the prediction period (i.e. from '--pred_start_date' to '--pred_end_date') as well as the records in the period which is at least 2 hours before the first timestamp for prediction (i.e. >=2 hours before '--pred_start_date'). Say, for instance, if '--pred_start_date' was set to be '2021-05-05 00:00:00' and '--seq_len' was 8, then the input weather forecasting data should at least contain the records between '2021-05-04 22:00:00' and '2021-05-04 23:45:00' (weather forecasting records before '2021-05-04 22:00:00' are also welcomed).
(2) Only the 'target' column of rows for the prediction can be blank or NaN. Other cells must be real numbers. In other words, you should fill the missing values in training data, validation data and the prediction inputs before running this program.
